# SkyDefender Plugin

## Download & usage

Please refer to the [spigot page](https:) to get an advanced description of what you can modify in the plugin, and to download the jar file.

## Further info

I did this plugin in a three days marathon (paper theory + coding + publishing), whereas I did know nothing about Java. So my code is pretty badly organized, but that was an interesting way to discover Java basics.

## License

Kinda pointless I guess but : [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
